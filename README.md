# paas-community

A repository where [GOV.UK PaaS](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk) and our user community store code snippets, demos, and recipes for how to run useful software.

If you're new to GOV.UK PaaS these examples can help teach you how to use it. If you're an established user you can learn new ways of doing things. This sits alongside our [written documentation](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk).

## Other sources of examples

GOV.UK PaaS is based on Cloud Foundry. The Cloud Foundry community maintain another shared set of examples in [the cloudfoundry-samples GitHub organisation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples)

Some of the GOV.UK PaaS tenants also have examples to share and ways they've solved problems too:
* How DfE are [using terraform to deploy a Prometheus ecosystem to Cloud Foundry for monitoring](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/cf-monitoring/) on GOV.UK PaaS
* Recordings of presentations from our [GOV.UK PaaS Community Show and Tells are available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5tovFCB3CsDl4_kwKdWL8tXuMbP2LVH7)
