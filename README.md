# paas-community

A repository where [GOV.UK PaaS](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk) and our user community store code snippets, demos, and recipes for how to run useful software.

If you're new to GOV.UK PaaS these examples can help teach you how to use it. If you're an established user you can learn new ways of doing things. This sits alongside our [written documentation](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk).
